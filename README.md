# Shiny Web Application: Statistical Data on the European Union Countries

- The web application shows statistical data about the countries in the European Union together with Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein, which are either members of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) or the Schengen Area

- The data is for 2014 and is taken from Eurostat

- Select a parameter from the drop-down menu

- The interactive map is redrawn to show the values of the chosen parameter

- Hover with the mouse over the map to see the name of the corresponding country together with the value of the chosen parameter for this country

- The markers are placed at the geographical location of each capital

- Click with the mouse on a marker to see the name of the respective capital

- Push one of the two buttons: Box plot or Histogram

- If Box plot is chosen, the red cross represents the mean

- If Histogram is chosen, move the slider to set the number of bins (the optimal number of bins for each parameter is calculated according to the Freedman-Diaconis rule and is set by default as the initial value of the slider)
